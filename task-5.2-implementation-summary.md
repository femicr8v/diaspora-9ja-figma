# Task 5.2 Implementation Summary

## Task Requirements

- ✅ Distinguish between new payments and subscription renewals in admin emails
- ✅ Extract payment data for email templates from Stripe webhook data
- ✅ Handle edge cases where customer data might be missing
- ✅ Add error handling to log email failures without affecting payment processing

## Implementation Details

### 1. Payment Type Distinction ✅

**Location**: `src/app/api/webhook/route.ts` - `sendPaymentEmails()` function

**Implementation**:

- Added `isSubscription` parameter to distinguish payment types
- Enhanced logging with payment type context:
  ```typescript
  const paymentType = isSubscription ? "subscription renewal" : "new payment";
  console.log(
    `📧 Initiating ${paymentType} emails for ${customerEmail} - ${tierName}`
  );
  ```
- Different email templates for new payments vs subscription renewals
- Enhanced admin notifications with payment type specific messaging

**Email Service Updates**: `src/lib/email-service.ts`

- Admin notifications now include payment type in subject and body
- User confirmations have different messaging for renewals vs new payments
- Templates distinguish between "New Payment" and "Subscription Renewal"

### 2. Stripe Webhook Data Extraction ✅

**Location**: `src/app/api/webhook/route.ts`

**Implementation**:

- **Checkout Sessions** (`checkout.session.completed`):

  - Extracts customer details from `session.customer_details`
  - Gets tier name from line items and product data
  - Handles missing customer data gracefully
  - Passes `isSubscription: false` for new payments

- **Invoice Payments** (`invoice.payment_succeeded`):
  - Extracts customer data from subscription customer object
  - Gets tier name from subscription items
  - Handles subscription-specific data
  - Passes `isSubscription: true` for renewals

**Data Extracted**:

- Customer email and name
- Payment amount (converted from cents to dollars)
- Currency
- Tier/product name
- Payment context (session ID, invoice ID, subscription ID)

### 3. Edge Case Handling ✅

**Location**: `src/app/api/webhook/route.ts` - Enhanced `sendPaymentEmails()` function

**Implementation**:

- **Enhanced Validation**:

  ```typescript
  const validationErrors: string[] = [];
  if (!customerEmail || typeof customerEmail !== "string") {
    validationErrors.push("customerEmail is required and must be a string");
  }
  // ... additional validations
  ```

- **Data Sanitization**:

  ```typescript
  const sanitizedEmail = customerEmail.toLowerCase().trim();
  const sanitizedName = customerName.trim().substring(0, 100);
  const sanitizedTierName = (tierName || "Unknown Tier")
    .trim()
    .substring(0, 50);
  ```

- **Email Format Validation**:

  ```typescript
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  if (!emailRegex.test(sanitizedEmail)) {
    console.warn("⚠️ Invalid email format detected:", { ... });
    return;
  }
  ```

- **Graceful Degradation**:
  - Uses fallback values for missing data ("Customer", "Unknown Tier", "usd")
  - Logs warnings when data is missing but continues processing
  - Skips email sending if critical data is missing

### 4. Error Handling Without Affecting Payment Processing ✅

**Location**: `src/app/api/webhook/route.ts` and `src/lib/email-service.ts`

**Implementation**:

- **Async Email Sending**: Emails are sent asynchronously without blocking webhook response
- **Promise.allSettled**: Uses `emailService.sendEmailsAsync()` to ensure all emails are attempted
- **Comprehensive Error Logging**:

  ```typescript
  console.error("🚨 Critical error in payment email processing:", {
    error: errorMessage,
    stack: errorStack,
    customerEmail,
    // ... full context
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
  ```

- **Error Categorization**:

  - Timeout errors: "⏰ Email timeout detected - possible network issues"
  - Rate limits: "🚦 Email rate limit detected - may need to implement queuing"
  - Authentication: "🔐 Email authentication error - check API keys"

- **Non-blocking Operations**: All email operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- **Webhook Continues**: Payment processing continues even if all emails fail

### 5. Enhanced Features (Beyond Requirements)

**Payment Context Tracking**:

- Added `paymentContext` parameter to track session IDs, invoice IDs, and subscription IDs
- Enhanced logging with full context for debugging

**Email Summary Statistics**:

```typescript
const successCount = results.filter((r) => r.success).length;
const failureCount = results.length - successCount;
console.log(
  `📊 ${paymentType} email summary: ${successCount} sent, ${failureCount} failed`
);
```

**Enhanced Email Templates**:

- Payment type specific subject lines
- Different messaging for new vs renewal payments
- More detailed payment information
- Better user experience messaging

## Testing

**Test Coverage**: `src/test/webhook-payment-emails.test.ts`

- Payment type distinction testing
- Data validation and sanitization testing
- Error handling verification
- Payment context tracking
- Logging and monitoring verification

**Existing Tests**: All existing email service and template tests continue to pass

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/webhook/route.ts` - Enhanced payment email logic
2. `src/lib/email-service.ts` - Updated email templates with payment type distinction
3. `src/test/webhook-payment-emails.test.ts` - New comprehensive test suite

## Verification

All task requirements have been successfully implemented:

- ✅ Payment types are clearly distinguished in both admin and user emails
- ✅ All relevant payment data is extracted from Stripe webhooks
- ✅ Edge cases with missing customer data are handled gracefully
- ✅ Email failures are logged comprehensively without affecting payment processing
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and monitoring capabilities added
